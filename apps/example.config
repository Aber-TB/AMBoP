#First specify the full path to where you want to output all the data to. This is automatically set to the directory you are currently in when you run AMBoP.

#Set the path to where the raw data is.

#Set the raw read file patterns for forward and reverse. Look for things that are common to all forward and reverse files such that when you use this pattern with the ls command, it finds them all.

#These settings will be implemented in AMBoP 0.41 "control" but are not used in AMBoP 0.35 "stricter". If running AMBoP 0.35 "stricter" you can either delete these lines or just ignore them. 

#These settings change how strict the SNP filtering is. The defaults set are relaxed. See documentation for AMBoP 0.41 "control" for alternatives. 
MQ=30 #Mapping quality.
DP=10 #Depth of reads covering site.
DP4F=1 #Number of supporting forward reads.
DP4R=1 #Number of supporting reverse reads.
SUPPORT=0.80 #Percentage (give as decimal) of reads needed to support an alternative site.

#Set the level of clear up you'd like after AMBoP has completed. The files AMBoP creates can be very large, including bam files and vcf files. The default as below is set to ALL, which will remove all intermediate files. Change this to "NONE" to delete none of the intermediate files, or give a comma separated list (in double quotes) of any of the following to delete just those directories:
#TRIMMEDREADS, BAMS, PASSEDFILES, FASTA, VARIANTS
CLEARUP="ALL"  


#--------
#Note that users currently do not have control over trimming settings, but in AMBoP 0.35 "stricter" these have been set to:
#ILLUMINACLIP:trimmomatic_adapters.fasta:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:3:20 MINLEN:50 AVGQUAL:20 in accordance with previous publications.
#and for AMBoP 0.41 "control", they are set to: 
#ILLUMINACLIP:trimmomatic_adapters.fasta:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:10:20 MINLEN:50 AVGQUAL:20 in accordance with previous publications and APHA recommendations.
